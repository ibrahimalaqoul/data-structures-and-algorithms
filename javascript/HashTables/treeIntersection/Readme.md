# Challenge Summary
The challange is about finding the intersection for  two binary trees in Hash Table and return them as an array.


## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
i used for loop to iterate through the array and check if the value is present in the hash table.
* BigO Time complexity : O(n) That's o(2n) while i'm iterating  two times through two different arrays which will be approximately o(n);
* BigO Space complexity : O(n) because i'm creating a space that depens on the size of the second array input so it will be o(n);

## Solution
 
 npm  test tree-intersection.test
