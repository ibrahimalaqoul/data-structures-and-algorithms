# Stacks and Queues
Stack and Queues are data structures that follow different patterns 
the stack has a vertical shape first in last out, the queues follows first in first out.
## Challenge
The challange asked us to add ( push,pop,peek,isEmpty) For the stack class also (enqueue,dequeue,peek,isEmpty) For the Queue.

## Approach & Efficiency
push ----> BigO O(1) 
pop ----> BigO O(1) 
peek ----> BigO O(1) 
isEmpty ----> BigO O(1) 
enqueue ----> BigO O(1) 
dequeue ----> BigO O(1) 
peek ----> BigO O(1) 
isEmpty ----> BigO O(1) 


## API
npm test stack.test,
npm test queue.test,
